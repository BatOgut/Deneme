# I need help

I have to make an exercise project for my homework, I have to make an armstrong number calculator in python 

But I cant make it i use for and it gives error

I use for loop for index 
it works like 

a = input("Num: ")
b = len(a)
a = int(a)

c = 0
for i in range(0,b):
  c += a[i] ** b
  
if(a == c):
  print("its an armstrong Num")
else:
  print("its not")


it doesnt work
  
  
  
  
PLS HELP
